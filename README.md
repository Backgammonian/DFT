# DFT
This WPF app allows to perform DFT algorithm on discrete counts of sine with given phase, magnitude and frequency. This app is created for spectrum leakage effect demonstation. Such effect occurs when the signal being measured is not periodic in the sample interval. That happens because DFT returns correct answer when the input data sequence contains energy right on frequency that is multiple of fundamental frequency: Fs/N, where Fs - sample rate, N - number of discrete counts.
